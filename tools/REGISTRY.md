## CLI Tools

Zero-dependency, single-file Node.js CLIs for tools that don't ship their own. See [`clis/README.md`](clis/README.md) for install instructions and usage.

All CLIs follow a consistent pattern:
- **No dependencies** — Node 18+ only, uses native `fetch`
- **JSON output** — pipe to `jq`, save to file, or use in scripts
- **Env var auth** — set `{TOOL}_API_KEY` and go
- **Consistent commands** — `{tool} <resource> <action> [options]`

---
