# Demo Script Templates

## Discovery Call Script

### Scene 1: Opening (3 min)

**Talk track:**
> "Thanks for taking the time, [Name]. I've done some research on [Company] but I'd love to hear from you directly. My goal for today is to understand what you're working on and see if there's a fit — and if there's not, I'll tell you that too. Sound good?"

**What to establish:**
- Set the agenda and time expectation

## Interaction Point Guidance

### When to Ask Questions During Demos

- **After showing each workflow** — "How does this compare to your current process?"
- **When you see a reaction** — "I noticed you reacted to that — what are you thinking?"
- **Before moving to the next section** — "Any questions on this before we move on?"
- **When showing a differentiator** — "How would your team use this?"
- **At the midpoint** — "Are we covering the right things, or should we adjust?"

### Questions NOT to Ask During Demos

- "Does that make sense?" (patronizing)
- "Are you still with me?" (implies they're lost)
- "Isn't that cool?" (salesy)
- Rhetorical questions that don't invite real dialogue

### How to Handle "Can You Show Me X?"

When a prospect asks to see something during the demo:

1. **If it's quick** — show it now, then return to your flow
2. **If it's a tangent** — "Great question. Let me note that and show you after the main flow so we stay on track."
3. **If it's not possible** — "We don't do that today. Here's how customers handle it: [alternative]."

Never say "I'll get back to you" without writing it down and following up within 24 hours.
