## Layout Guidance

### Visual Hierarchy

1. **Headline** — Largest text, top of page, immediately communicates value
2. **Section headers** — Bold, clear, act as scannable anchors
3. **Body text** — Short sentences, bullet points preferred over paragraphs
4. **Proof elements** — Metrics and quotes should visually stand out (larger font, color, or callout box)
5. **CTA** — Prominent placement, bottom of page or bottom-right

### Whitespace

- Margins: at least 0.75" on all sides
- Space between sections: enough to visually separate (don't cram)
- If it feels crowded, cut content. Never shrink font below 9pt.

### Font Sizing

| Element | Suggested Size |
|---------|---------------|
| Headline | 18-24pt |
| Section headers | 12-14pt bold |
| Body text | 10-11pt |
| Fine print / footer | 8-9pt |

### Color

- Use brand colors for headers and accents
- Keep body text dark (black or near-black) on white
- Limit accent colors to 1-2 for visual consistency
- Use color to draw attention to metrics and CTAs

### File Format

- **PDF** for email attachments and leave-behinds
- **Google Slides / PowerPoint** for editable versions reps can customize
- Always include both — reps will customize, prospects want clean PDFs
